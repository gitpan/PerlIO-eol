[Changes for 0.06 - 2004-10-15]

* Macroize the inner fill() loop into fill.h, which saves many cycles.
* In particular, 'LF' and 'Native' on LF platforms should now only have
  minimum overhead over ':raw' if the processed stream does not contain CRs.

[Changes for 0.05 - 2004-10-09]

* PerlIO_read() calls were returning unneeded errors when the
  read block is only partially filled.  Fix this by taking
  _read calls into our hands and save some bits of indirection.

[Changes for 0.04 - 2004-10-09]

* We now optionally exports CR, LF, CRLF and NATIVE constants,
  at requests from Chia-Liang Kao.
* eol_is_mixed is now prototyped as ($).

[Changes for 0.03 - 2004-10-08]

* Fix building problems on Win32.
* Support the "Native" eol style.
* Added I/O-specific syntax like "LF-Native", which means reading with LF
  and writing to Native; this what "svn:eol-style = native" means.
* Optionally exports a "eol_is_mixed" function, to determine whether a string
  has an inconsistent line ending style.

[Changes for 0.02 - 2004-10-07]

* Fixed the buffer offset problem on non-CRLF settings.
* Trailing data for read operations were ignored.  Oops.

[Changes for 0.01 - 2004-10-07]

* Initial release to CPAN.
